Create classes
-Team (each team has a name, coach, a number of players and a list of players)
-Coaches (has a name)
-Players (Each player has a name, positions they can play, height, and birth place)
-Positions (has a string)

Use a Scanner to read in the teams.txt file
Go through each bit of data and create new objects of the classes
Add each object to an array of that class
Use those arrays and classes to fulfil the methods needed for each user type (office/media/etc.)
