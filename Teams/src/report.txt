For this project I made a Team class, a TeamMember interface which the Coach
class and the Player class implement. In addition I made a Position class 
which feeds into Positions arrays which the Player class uses in its field. I
used arrays so that it would be easier to deal with players that played more
than one position.

The program will allow office staff to list all teams, as well as list each team's
coach below the team. It will allow media organisations to get a list of players
in a team with their biographical information, as well as a list of players on 
that team that play specific positions. It will allow managers to find players
on all teams within a specified height range.

The methods that I implemented in this project were the same and in the same
order as those given. I didn't haven't much time to do anything special because
I struggled with setting up the file to read in and store the various bits of
info due to input mismatch errors. I now feel confident that I can handle 
those when they inevitably come up again in the future!

The ListPositionPlayersOnTeam was quite difficult, perhaps because of how I
implemented it, but it works (I think)! Due to using a Positions class
and accompanying array lists (which I thought would make things easier), I 
had to iterate through lots of arrays to get what I needed.

Spent a while at the end trying to make the graph work, didn't get there in the end.
I wanted to ask if the user wanted to see heights by team or by position, add the heights
of the given team or the given position to an array and then access the array and print
a bar graph.
